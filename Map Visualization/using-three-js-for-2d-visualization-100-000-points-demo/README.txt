A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/fnumegha/pen/PgNRJP.

 This is a companion pen to go along with https://beta.observablehq.com/@grantcuster/using-three-js-for-2d-data-visualization. It shows a three.js pan and zoom example using d3-zoom working on 100,000 points. The code isn't very organized here so I recommend you check out the notebook to see what is going on.
